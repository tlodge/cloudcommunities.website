<p>We&#8217;re delighted to announce that we have been funded by the <a href='www.itutility.ac.uk'>IT as a utility programme</a> The project will start in March 2014 and run for 6 months. The project will aim to understand technology&#8217;s role in addressing the challenges and problems faced by communities in high-density and high-rise properties. The preliminary work will characterise the problem space; we&#8217;d like to work with as many residential communities and affiliated institutions (managing agents, freeholders, residents committees and so forth) as possible. We&#8217;ll be publishing surveys and reports on this site. If you would like get involved in this project (or would like to know more), please get in contact with us.</p>
