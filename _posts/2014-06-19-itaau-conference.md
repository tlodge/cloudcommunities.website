The annual ITAAU conference took place in Southampton between the 19th and 20th June.  It was a great opportunity to at last connect with other ITAAU funded projects and to get a better idea of the breadth and depth of the work that is going on.  It was a pretty packed schedule and there were some genuinely excellent and inspiring keynotes (which didn’t help the nerves of the few of us that are less practiced at public speaking).    Thanks to Steve and Sarah for all the effort they put into these two days.  

My highlights?  Sian Thomas of the The Food Standards Agency – an excellent and very engaging presentation.  And Graham Lake: The value of urgent reconfiguration of IT utilities.  I only got to watch the first part of Dave De Roure’s keynote: Taking IT for granted: a long view into the future – I’d loved to seen it to the end.
