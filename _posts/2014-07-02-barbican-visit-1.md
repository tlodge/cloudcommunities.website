Welcome to *Sarah Fox*, a Phd from Washington University who has taken a summer internship at Microsoft Research.   Extract from her first site visit to the Barbican:

>As I exited the Barbican train station, it was a bit hard to get a handle on what was in front of me. I saw an edge or two of the concrete buildings I had been looking at yesterday on the internet, but wasn’t really sure about how I should go about getting to them. I was about a level lower than the two buildings I recognized to the right and in front of me was a tunnel. I opted to walk through the tunnel because I saw other people moving in and out of it, but I didn’t see anyone going toward the Barbican Estate buildings to the right. I felt a little uneasy about walking straight up to them. I thought maybe the underpass would lead to a grander entrance that would be easier to read.
