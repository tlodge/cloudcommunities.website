There is an opening for a three month internship for a PhD student at Microsoft Research, Cambridge, beginning April 2014.  The internship will consist of a design-oriented ethnography of high-rise and high-density urban living, with a focus on the technologies used in this kind of communal living.  See <a href="/assets/doc/community_clouds_internship.pdf">here</a> for more information.
