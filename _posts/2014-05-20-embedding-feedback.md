title: Embedding feedback in the infrastructure
layout: post
---
High-rises already have a bunch of infrastructure that users interact with on a daily basis.  Examples include buttons next to doors that unlock them, lift buttons, keypads on gates, bins, underground parking and so forth.   These are single purpose objects that could be re-appropriated as points for providing additional feedback (on for example wellbeing).  One could imagine, for example, an array of buttons next to a door, each of which provide the same base function (i.e. unlock the door).  But each will register a different mood:

Might also be interesting to play with how results are displayed.  A semi-private space, such as a shared screen in a foyer / concierge office; would this encourage discussion/conversation?
