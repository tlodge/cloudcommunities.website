As a way to encourage debate on governance in the Barbican we posted the following:

and some quotes:

>If someone doesn't have the time (or even the temperament or abilities) to volunteer to help out, it doesn't mean their criticisms aren't valid.

>It's all very well for a house group member to say that anyone can join the committee and have a say. But most of us lack the will or the time to be useful members of a committee that on occasion has to deal with complicated matters.

>How come such a tiny number of residents can put a spanner in the works for the rest of us? Please, not more delays!

>Ask us to study, say, all the CrossRail papers, and most of us will melt away, while grateful to those few who stay. But ask us to express a preference about the colour of our flats and a far greater number will not only take an interest but will also have a valid view.

>Is it right that unpaid volunteers find themselves responsible for (and exert influence over) hundreds of millions of pounds worth of real estate, (not to mention residents' lives)? Should they be 'cut some slack', given that they donate their time and take on the responsibility? Can they take a truly unbiased position on all decisions?
