             <h1> Rules in The Barbican </h1>
                <p>To encourage debate on rules the Barbican we posted the following:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/comic/rules_small.png" alt="governance in the barbican" /></p>

<p>and a few quotes from residents: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe its my profession taking over, but ‘rules are rules’ is too simplistic. Rules intended to prevent neighbours getting annoyed should be applied flexibly to cases where there isn’t actually any reason to get annoyed. To take an analogy, it’s unlawful for someone to touch you without your permission. But that doesn’t mean you can sue everyone who bumps into you at rush hour on the tube; you need to show you’ve suffered some harm. As judges like to say, de minimis non curat lex.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know it is easy to mock some of its more fastidious clauses, but actually I wish the Estate Office did more to enforce the rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this day and age so many people buy or rent flats elsewhere and never really pay much attention to the rules and nothing is normally done about this</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>OK, so people don’t have to live here. But that doesn’t mean that everything in the lease is automatically justified. It’s not as if the lease is a democratic instrument agreed by the will of the residents. It was written by lawyers working for the Corporation and reflects the Corporations ideas, circa 1981 or whenever they started selling off the flats, of what should and shouldn’t be allowed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I’m aware, the lease is the only legally binding document that owners (leaseholders) are bound to. In spite of the fact that it’s a fairly heavyweight legal document, it appears that certain clauses are open to interpretation and that some are more strongly enforced than others. Would it make sense for the Barbican to have a more informal (fluid/readable) document that presents ‘acceptable’ interpretations of clauses in the lease?</p>
