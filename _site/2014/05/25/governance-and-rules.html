             <h1> Governance and Rules </h1>
                <p>There is a complexity in the interplay between the various formal and informal groups that work to govern a building.   To understand it, we have to briefly consider the journey from when a property is first created to its eventual commission and occupancy.  A development is first built on behalf of the land owner – known as the freeholder.   The freeholder will ‘sell’ each apartment to pay for the costs of building.  In reality, a property is not sold, but leased, for a long period of time (usually 99 years or more).  The new owners are known as leaseholders, and, as a condition of the lease they will pay a regular charge to the freeholder known as ground rent.   </p>

<p>The freeholder is an individual or business bound by two principle motivations; that their development will earn money and that it will continue to be maintained to a good standard.   To help accomplish this, they create a ‘lease’: a set of legally enforceable rules setting out what a leaseholder is and is not allowed to do within a development.   They will also employ a management company who will be responsible for the upkeep of the development. <br />
Unsurprisingly, the lease is very specific with regard to payment of ground rent, management charges and responsibilities relating to repair and alterations.  There are often far fewer rules relating to day-to-day living within a development.</p>

<p>So how are problems negotiated and resolved currently?  It is a simple fact that residents forums are littered with conversations that fail to reach any productive conclusion.  In the best case, a community will run a residents association; a simple hierarchy where problems are fed to, and considered by a representative set of volunteer residents.  Although a residents association has no legal status it is often able to exert some influence upon the community.    And how well does this work?  Again, it depends. Ignoring the fact that residents are volunteers (and what this implies relation to the amount of time they are willing to spend in this role), there are certain characteristics of high-rise communities that can make it hard to operate successfully: familiar strangers, bound only by geography, whose principal motivations may be more strongly influenced by material concerns than values.  Moreover, and perhaps most crucially, effective cooperation can require shifts in behaviour in order achieve synchronisation.     </p>

<p>In a widely cited TED talk, Clay Shirky, a social media theorist, offers up a tool commonly employed by open source programmers as inspiration for a ‘new form of arguing’.  The tool (git) allows programmers to cooperate to create complex code offer a decentralised, flat, inclusive system that promotes ‘cooperation without coordination’.    The approach, he argues, could be applied to law; what would it mean to make laws fluid, transparent and shareable in which the entire lifecycle of amendments are annotated and traceable?   Consider how a law that has been shown to work particularly well in one state could be pulled, modified and integrated into the laws of another.
What would it mean to codify and share rules related to living?  How can this be effectively sourced and updated by the community? Can sets of rules be shared between developments?</p>
