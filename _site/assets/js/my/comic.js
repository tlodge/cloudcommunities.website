												overview: "The Barbican has several volunteer residents committees who act on behalf of the rest of the community, to make decisions in the interest of all.  <strong> How well does this work? </strong>",
												thoughts:"Many residents <strong> give up their time </strong> to help manage the Barbican.  Although 'just' volunteers, they may need to negotiate domains as wide ranging as engineering, planning, law, architecture and technology.  Their roles may be equally diverse: resolving disputes, improving and maintaining the estate, liaising with fellow residents, councillors, MPs, planners and management.  <strong> Is it right that unpaid volunteers find themselves responsible for (and exert influence over) hundreds of millions of pounds worth of real estate</strong>, (not to mention residents' lives)? Should they be 'cut some slack', given that they donate their time and take on the responsibility?  And given they're residents can they take an unbiased position on all decisions? Here are a few choice quotes from discussions on barbicantalk:  <blockquote>If someone doesn't have the time (or even the temperament or abilities) to volunteer to help out, it doesn't mean their criticisms aren't valid. But, having said that, thank you, once again, for all the work you and others do.</blockquote><blockquote>It's all very well for a house group member to say that anyone can join the committee and have a say.Â  But most of us lack the will or the time to be useful members of a committee that on occasion has to deal with complicated matters.</blockquote><blockquote>How come such a tiny number of residents can put a spanner in the works for the rest of us? Please, not more delays!</blockquote>",

												overview: "Barbican talk is an amazing resource with over <strong>2000</strong> members, and over <strong>50,000</strong> posts.  But how well do forums work?",
												thoughts:"We've not looked through all <strong>50,000</strong> posts - not even close.  But it is clear that the forum is being used for a <strong>huge range of purposes</strong>: socialising, recommendations, advice (sought and offered), warnings, complaints, community action.  The forum is a <strong>rich but unwieldy resource</strong>; useful information ('where can I buy x?') jostles up against outdated content ('anyone experiencing tv reception problems at the moment?) and lengthy debates.  There have been many discussions on <strong>moderation, anonymity and participation</strong> (i.e. restricted to residents or open to all). How could we design a <strong>better communication service</strong>?  Would full anonymity be useful in certain cases?  Would it be useful to send messages to apartments, floors and blocks (or even 'the owner of the car in bay X').  And can we make it easier for residents to get a message out to fellow residents - an app or even a dedicated 'apartment appliance'?",

												overview: "High-rise residents are legally bound by the terms of the <strong>lease</strong>.  Despite being a fairly <strong>rigid</strong> and <strong>formal</strong> document, it is open to interpretation; there are also many day to day rules that it does not cover.",
												thoughts:"Do the rules in the <strong>lease</strong> really represent the <strong>wants and needs</strong> of current Barbican residents?  Does it make sense to have rules applied estate-wide, or would it be better to let different <strong>towers and blocks to set their own terms?</strong> What systems need to exist in order to allow residents to adapt rules over time in sympathy with <strong>changing needs</strong> and attitudes?",

But could the Barbican community be coordinated to extend and increase its power?",
